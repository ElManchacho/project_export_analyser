# The analysis' reports will appear in this folder

Each analysis is classified in a designed folder, named report_'number', the number being a timestamp.

In this folder you will find a .txt file that explicitly explain the analysis and a .xlsx file in which the analysed components are classified, counted and located among your project files.
